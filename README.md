# excel4node

## Note on this library

I started this library back in 2014 as a side project to fulfill a need for a
project I was working on where no other solution existed. After I was finished
being a part of that project I tried to continue to maintain this library, but
life circumstances change and I have accepted that I do not have the time
available to maintain this library at the level it needs.

I am grateful for the devs at avisr.io who have agreed to take ownership of the
[excel4node package on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/excel4node) and all
future work will occur on their fork at
[advisr-io/excel4node](https://github.com/advisr-io/excel4node).
